The repository I am working on is a collection of different banner designs, each of which can be used in different types of projects. The repository is designed to make it easier for web developers and designers to choose and implement the right banner design for their project without the need to spend time creating one from scratch.
The collection is divided into different folders, with each folder containing a different banner design. The banners in the repository are created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and are designed to be responsive, meaning they will adapt to different screen sizes and device types. Each banner design is customizable, allowing users to change the colors, fonts, images, and other design elements to match the look and feel of their project.
The repository includes a variety of banner designs, ranging from simple text-based banners to more complex designs that incorporate images and animations. Some of the banner designs in the repository include:
</p>

- Call-to-action banners that encourage users to take a specific action, such as signing up for a newsletter or making a purchase.
- Sale banners that can be used to promote discounts or special offers.
- Event banners that can be used to promote upcoming events or promotions.
- Image-based banners that can be used to showcase products or services.
- Animated banners that include animations and other interactive elements.
<p align="justify">
One of the major features of the repository is that it is regularly updated with new banner designs. Users can also contribute their own banner designs to the repository, which can be added to the collection and shared with others. Additionally, the repository includes detailed documentation and instructions on how to use and customize each banner design, making it easy for users to get started and create professional-looking banners for their projects.
